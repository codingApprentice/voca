Control your computer by voice!

Features
========


- Write your own commands using a simple syntax, or use the existing ones.
- Different commands are available for each app, in addition to globally available commands.
- When editing a command file, your new commands are immediately available as soon as you save. No need to fiddle with reloading.
- If there's a fatal error in a command file, don't worry -- Voca simply uses a backup from the last time that file worked.
- Your commands are executed asynchronously, so you never need to wait for one to finish before executing the next.
- Get immediate visual feedback during an utterance -- Voca's *eager mode* can start acting on your commands as soon as the first word in your utterance. Switch to *strict mode* and Voca will wait until the end of your utterance.
- Voca uses a modern parser, so your grammar can be arbitrarily complex.
- Use any speech engine you like -- Voca takes its input as newline-separated json on stdin.
- Voca generates detailed structured logs you can use for debugging or analyzing your command history.
- Voca provides adapters for current Caster and Dragonfly commands, so you can keep using commands you like -- just install Voca alongside Caster. More plugins and adapters for other systems can be added.
- Voca has a pluggable architecture. Install independent plugins for controlling your apps, without needing to fork the main repository.
- Voca uses Python 3.7+, so all the newest Python features are available.
- Voca is continuously tested in CI, and maintains test coverage checks.
- Free and open source, licensed GPLv3.

Limitations
===========


- Nobody has used it at all, so I don't know if it's useful.
- Voca does not provide a speech engine; it requires input from an existing one like Dragon, Kaldi, or DeepSpeech.
- Multiple platforms are planned, and the basic outline is there, but tests are not currently passing on OSX or Windows. Linux is working.
- The documentation is minimal.


Installation
============

::

    pip install voca


Documentation
=============

Prerequisites:

- A speech engine, e.g. kaldi/silvius server via included docker script or on its website
- Microphone
- Python 3



Development
===========

- git clone this repo and cd inside
- To start the kaldi server and workers in docker, plus a client listening to your mic, run ``./run-kaldi-server.sh``
- ``./pycli init`` will create a virtualenv and install the package into it
- ``./venv/bin/voca manage`` to start the manager process which accepts commands on stdin. The manager will start its workers.


To run the all tests run::

    tox

Note, to combine the coverage data from all the tox environments run:
